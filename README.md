An application that will input a list of employees and with their first name, last name, and salary. Enter as many employees as you want, the input process will repeat unitl the user confirms to the application that they are done. The appliction will display all employees in a table format. Within the console, the application will calacualte the average salary of all the employees and will pick one at random for any desired purpose. Builidng this app gave me my first taste of using JavaScipt in a real world application and taught me a lot about JS behavior and functionality.

## Usage
Click add employee and follow the prompts that will ask for the employee's information. The 4th prompt will ask if you'd like to add another employee, click yes to return to the beginning of the propmts to enter another employee or click no to finalize your entries.
